# Stacked  Auto-Encoder (Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project)\

In this porject I took three different approaches tofeature extraction being utilized in supervised and unsupervisedlearning technique. 
* The first goal of this project is presented as ain-depth comparison of stacked auto-encoder with support vectormachine  and  multi-layer  perceptron.  
* The  second  goal  of  thisproject is to implement quadratic mutual information loss whichallows  to  make  an  efficient  non-parametric  implementation.  thecomputational  complexity  for  each  of  the  methods  above  is  alsopresented in addition to the role of hyper-parameters. 
* The thirdpart  of  the  project  involved  implementing  a  classifier  when  thenumber of outputs from the bottle neck layer were not equal tothe  true  target  labels.  
At  the  end  we  do  an  extensive  review  of all  the  three  methodologies  used  in  this  project.
